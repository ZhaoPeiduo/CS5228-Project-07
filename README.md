#### Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction in Telecommunications Companies
 
This repository contains the code for CS5228 Course Mini Project, which aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer churns based on a set of features.

#### Quick Start

To set up the environment for the project, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To make a virtual environment, either use the following command or consider [virtualenvwrapper for linux](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [for windows](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper-win/).

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
